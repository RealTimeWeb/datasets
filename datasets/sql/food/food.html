<p>
The following data comes from the United States Department of Agriculture's Food Composition Database.  It contains data for various types of food including the amounts of different vitamins and minerals found in the foods as well as macronutrient percentages.  The food covered spans a large variety of foods from butter to Campbell's soup. Much of the supplementary documenation for each field comes directly from that pages' Wikipedia article.

There is ongoing research into the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as high blood pressure, heart disease, and diabetes. However, taking magnesium supplements is not currently recommended. Diets high in protein, calcium, or vitamin D will increase the need for magnesium.
