This searchable database contains a table with the name, address, industry, and associated Total Case Rate (TCR), Days Away, Restricted, and Transfer (DART) case rate, and the Days Away From Work (DAFWII) case rate for the establishments that provided OSHA with valid data for calendar years 2002 through 2011.\nThis data has been sampled down from its original size to 4%. In addition, the original dataset only has data from a small portion of all private sector establishments in the United States (80,000 out of 7.5 million total establishments). Therefore, these data are not representative of all businesses and general conclusions pertaining to all US business should not be overdrawn.\nData quality: While OSHA takes multiple steps to ensure the data collected is accurate, problems and errors invariably exist for a small percentage of establishments. OSHA does not believe the data for the establishments with the highest rates on this file are accurate in absolute terms. Efforts were made during the collection cycle to correct submission errors, however some remain unresolved. It would be a mistake to say establishments with the highest rates on this file are the 'most dangerous' or 'worst' establishments in the Nation.\nRate Calculation: An incidence rate of injuries and illnesses is computed from the following formula: (Number of injuries and illnesses X 200,000) / Employee hours worked = Incidence rate. The Total Case Rate includes all cases recorded on the OSHA Form 300 (Column G + Column H + Column I + Column J). The Days Away/Restriced/Transfer includes cases recorded in Column H + Column I.

In the late 1980s, he made it (and the documentation necessary to use it) publicly available. </p><p> Since then, Professor Spaeth has not only updated it each term; he has also continued to perform reliability analyses, thereby ensuring its integrity with each release, and added new variables.

This data collection is called the OSHA Data Initiative or ODI. The data provided is used by OSHA to calculate establishment specific injury and illness incidence rates. This searchable database contains a table with the name, address, industry, and associated Total Case Rate (TCR), Days Away, Restricted, and Transfer (DART) case rate, and the Days Away From Work (DAFWII) case rate for the establishments that provided OSHA with valid data for calendar years 2002 through 2011.\nThis data has been sampled down from its original size to 4%. In addition, the original dataset only has data from a small portion of all private sector establishments in the United States (80,000 out of 7.5 million total establishments). Therefore, these data are not representative of all businesses and general conclusions pertaining to all US business should not be overdrawn.\nData quality: While OSHA takes multiple steps to ensure the data collected is accurate, problems and errors invariably exist for a small percentage of establishments. OSHA does not believe the data for the establishments with the highest rates on this file are accurate in absolute terms. Efforts were made during the collection cycle to correct submission errors, however some remain unresolved. It would be a mistake to say establishments with the highest rates on this file are the 'most dangerous' or 'worst' establishments in the Nation.\nRate Calculation: An incidence rate of injuries and illnesses is computed from the following formula: (Number of injuries and illnesses X 200,000) / Employee hours worked = Incidence rate. The Total Case Rate includes all cases recorded on the OSHA Form 300 (Column G + Column H + Column I + Column J). The Days Away/Restriced/Transfer includes cases recorded in Column H + Column I. The Days Away includes cases recorded in Column H.

Professor Spaeth's goal was at once refreshingly simple and extremely ambitious: to produce a database that would include and classify every single vote by a Supreme Court justice in all argued cases over a five-decade period.

In addition, the original dataset only has data from a small portion of all private sector establishments in the United States (80,000 out of 7.5 million total establishments). Therefore, these data are not representative of all businesses and general conclusions pertaining to all US business should not be overdrawn.\nData quality: While OSHA takes multiple steps to ensure the data collected is accurate, problems and errors invariably exist for a small percentage of establishments. OSHA does not believe the data for the establishments with the highest rates on this file are accurate in absolute terms. Efforts were made during the collection cycle to correct submission errors, however some remain unresolved. It would be a mistake to say establishments with the highest rates on this file are the 'most dangerous' or 'worst' establishments in the Nation.\nRate Calculation: An incidence rate of injuries and illnesses is computed from the following formula: (Number of injuries and illnesses X 200,000) / Employee hours worked = Incidence rate. The Total Case Rate includes all cases recorded on the OSHA Form 300 (Column G + Column H + Column I + Column J). The Days Away/Restriced/Transfer includes cases recorded in Column H + Column I.

Therefore, these data are not representative of all businesses and general conclusions pertaining to all US business should not be overdrawn.\nData quality: While OSHA takes multiple steps to ensure the data collected is accurate, problems and errors invariably exist for a small percentage of establishments. OSHA does not believe the data for the establishments with the highest rates on this file are accurate in absolute terms. Efforts were made during the collection cycle to correct submission errors, however some remain unresolved. It would be a mistake to say establishments with the highest rates on this file are the 'most dangerous' or 'worst' establishments in the Nation.\nRate Calculation: An incidence rate of injuries and illnesses is computed from the following formula: (Number of injuries and illnesses X 200,000) / Employee hours worked = Incidence rate. The Total Case Rate includes all cases recorded on the OSHA Form 300 (Column G + Column H + Column I + Column J). The Days Away/Restriced/Transfer includes cases recorded in Column H + Column I.

Efforts were made during the collection cycle to correct submission errors, however some remain unresolved. It would be a mistake to say establishments with the highest rates on this file are the 'most dangerous' or 'worst' establishments in the Nation.\nRate Calculation: An incidence rate of injuries and illnesses is computed from the following formula: (Number of injuries and illnesses X 200,000) / Employee hours worked = Incidence rate. The Total Case Rate includes all cases recorded on the OSHA Form 300 (Column G + Column H + Column I + Column J). The Days Away/Restriced/Transfer includes cases recorded in Column H + Column I.

Efforts were made during the collection cycle to correct submission errors, however some remain unresolved. It would be a mistake to say establishments with the highest rates on this file are the 'most dangerous' or 'worst' establishments in the Nation.\nRate Calculation: An incidence rate of injuries and illnesses is computed from the following formula: (Number of injuries and illnesses X 200,000) / Employee hours worked = Incidence rate.
